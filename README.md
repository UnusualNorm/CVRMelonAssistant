## Notice!

There currently is no ChilloutVR Modding Group Discord that I know of, please ignore all references to the [ChilloutVR Modding Group Discord](https://discord.gg/rCqKSvR), the links simple redirect to the VRChat Modding Group Discord instead while I wait for one to come across my radar.

ChilloutVR Melon Assistant is a PC mod installer for ChilloutVR. It uses mods published in [ChilloutVR Modding Group Discord](https://discord.gg/rCqKSvR).  
It's a simple fork of [knah's VRChat Melon Assistant](https://github.com/knah/VRCMelonAssistant), a mod manager for VRChat.  
**Modifying the ChilloutVR client is allowed by ChilloutVR Terms of Service and can only lead to your account being banned if used maliciously.** Mods available via this installer are manually checked to minimize the chance of that happening, but the risk is always there.  
ChilloutVR Melon Assistant is not affiliated with and/or endorsed by Alpha Blend Interactive.

## Features

ChilloutVR Melon Assistant boasts a rich feature set, some of which include:

-   Installed mod detection
-   Mod uninstallation
-   Broken mod move-aside (temporarily uninstalls them until a fix is available)
-   Complex theming engine
-   Headpats and Hugs

## Usage

Download the newest build from the release section and run it. This application auto-updates when launched, there is no need to download a new release each time.  
Then, simply check off the mods that you wish to install or update and click the <kbd>Install or Update</kbd> button. Likewise, click the <kbd>Uninstall</kbd> button to remove any mods.

## Themes

ChilloutVR Melon Assistant should support themes for Mod Assistant. Check [its README](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant#themes) for more info on theming.  
However, this is not a supported feature. If something doesn't work, don't complain to either Assistant or knah.

## Common Issues

**I hit install but I don't see anything in game!**
Double check that you followed the [Usage](#usage) instructions correctly.  
 Make sure you're looking in the right place. Sometimes mod menus move as modding libraries/practices change.  
 Additionally, make sure the proper ChilloutVR installation directory is selected in option tab.

**I don't see a certain mod in the mods list!**
ChilloutVR Melon Assistant uses mods from ChilloutVR Modding Group and shows whatever is available for download. It's recommended to avoid non-CVRMG mods due to rampant spread of malware disguised as mods.

**I hit install but now my game won't launch, I can't click any buttons, I only see a black screen, etc**
